# 328. Odd Even Linked List
## 問題敘述

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```




## 思路歷程

使用雙指標並多創一個evenHead節點來連接奇數的節點，並接在Head的最尾端。



## 程式函數

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
//MTK Test!

struct ListNode* oddEvenList(struct ListNode* head){
    
    if (!head || !head->next) 
        return head;
    struct ListNode *odd = head, *even = head->next, *even_head = even;
        while (even!= NULL && even->next!=NULL) 
        {
            odd = odd->next = even->next;
            even = even->next = odd->next;
        }
        odd->next = even_head;
        return head;

}
```
